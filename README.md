## SALES DASHBOARD
Here I created a comprehensive Sales Dashboard for Madhav Ecommerce using PowerBi.
This Dynamic dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of key performance indicators(KPIs) to drive informed business decisions.
## Key Features:
* Sales Performance: Visualized trends and patterns in sales data to monitor performance across different periods.
* Customer Insights: Analized customer demographics and purchasing behaviors to enhance targeting strategies.
* Inventory Management: Tracked inventory levels and turnover rates to optimise stock.
* Revenue Analysis: Broke down revenue by product categories,regions and channels to identify top performers.
* Growth Opportunities: Highlighted potential areas for growth and improvement based on data driven insights.

 This project has honed my skills in data visualization,analytical thinking, and business intelligence.
